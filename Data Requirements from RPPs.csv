and resource management during subsequent disaster responses. For example, large-scale
disasters causing mass casualty (MASCAL) scenarios in the civilian medical system can be used to
optimize medical support using advanced medical technologies during large scale combat
operations. Key clinical questions must be identified before the fact, as well as performance
metrics that can be used to evaluate responses. Lessons learned about delivering medical
support to large scale disasters causing MASCAL scenarios in the civilian medical system can be
used to optimize medical and logistic support using advanced medical technologies during large
